# Liebling with Multilanguage

Liebling is a beautiful and clean [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) theme that is easy and comfortable to use. 

Within this fork I've customized it to support a multi-language blog.

For more details about the Liebling theme see the [official theme repository](https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling/wiki).

I got inspiratino from https://github.com/usepine/liebling-multilang.

This is still work in progress. I'll create a proper documentation when I'm done.
